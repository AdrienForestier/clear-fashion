ðŸ‘• What's the story behind each item of clothing you buy?

## ðŸŒŸ What have I done ?

I have done almost all the workshops proposed except some details in some of them.

## ðŸ”¨ How can I access the deployment ?

At the begining, when it was only local, I had environment variables to hide the URI for the cluster connection informations that can be sensitive. But with the deployment, the URI is now clear.
To access the deployment, you just need to go to [this link](server-adrienforestier.vercel.app).
Here's the link if the link above doesn't work : server-adrienforestier.vercel.app
